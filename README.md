# The Parking Lot Problem
Letâ€™s assume that we have a parking lot with fixed dimension, and there is a large variety of cars, busses, 
motorcycles and various other vehicles that need to be parked on it for long term. In the long term, we 
do not care where the individual vehicles are, and if they are accessible or not, all that we care about is 
to fit all of the vehicles on the lot. 

## Inputs
The input is multiple lines of text, with the individual elements being tab separated. The first line 
contains the length and width of the parking lot. The second line contains the number of vehicles. Each 
subsequent row contains the length and width of a single vehicle

 ## Implementation
Implement the filling up of the parking lot in Java or Python. The algorithm can be chosen freely, but 
you are not allowed to use any code that you yourself have not written.
